This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped from [Input Next Starter](https://github.com/inputlogic/next-starter) with some useful utilities, components, and settings that we ([Input Logic](https://github.com/inputlogic)) often need.

## Notes

- Uses pages router, not app router
- Uses Sass for styling
- All blog content is stored in /content as markdown files

## Local development

Start by creating a `.env.local` file in the project root. 

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=https://nrdbrn.xyz
```

Now install and run the project:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
