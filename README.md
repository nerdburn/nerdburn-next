This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and modified with some useful utilities, components, and settings that we ([Input Logic](https://github.com/inputlogic)) often need.

## Local development

Start by creating a `.env.local` file in the project root. You can use the [1Password Generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/) to create a random session secret easily.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV=dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
SESSION_SECRET=[RANDOM-32-CHARACTER-STRING]
```

Now install and run the project:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Connect to the API

Now that your frontend is running, you'll need an API. For a local development API, setup the [Django API Starter](https://github.com/inputlogic/django-api-starter).

If you'd like to skip this step, simply update your `.env.local` file to point to our staging API on Heroku:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://django-api-starter.herokuapp.com
```
